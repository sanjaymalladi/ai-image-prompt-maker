Your task is to generate a series of 6 distinct text prompts for AI image generation, based on this single character.

The 6 prompts must be:
1.  **"Character - Full Body Front View"**: A detailed description of the character seen from the front. Focus on their full body appearance, clothing, hairstyle, facial features, accessories, and any notable details.
2.  **"Character - Full Body Back View"**: A detailed description of the character seen from the back. Describe their clothing from behind, hairstyle from the back, and any details visible from this angle.
3.  **"Character - Full Body Side View"**: A detailed description of the character seen from the side (e.g., left profile). Describe their profile, clothing from the side, and posture.
4.  **"Character in Scene - Cinematic Front Shot"**: Describe the character (front-facing or slightly angled) within a simple, consistent background scene (e.g., "standing on a gritty urban street at night with neon signs in the background" or "in a sunlit meadow with tall grass"). The prompt should specify a camera shot like "medium full shot" or "cowboy shot". The focus is on the character integrated into this scene. The scene details for this prompt should be consistent.
5.  **"Character in Scene - Cinematic Back Shot"**: Describe the character (back-facing) within a background scene and lighting conditions. This scene can be different from the 'Cinematic Front Shot'. Use a similar camera shot (e.g., "medium full shot from behind"). The focus is on the character from behind, integrated into a scene.
6.  **"Character - Realistic Crazy Shot"**: ${crazyShotInstruction}

For all prompts, include details on:
- Subject appearance (as visible from the angle)
- Attire and textures
- Hairstyle and color
- Key distinguishing features
- For scene prompts: setting, lighting, mood, camera angle, and composition. The background scene elements for "Character in Scene - Cinematic Front Shot" (prompt 4) should be internally consistent for that prompt.

Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON array of objects.
Each object in the array MUST have a "title" field (exactly as listed above, e.g., "Character - Full Body Front View") and a "prompt" field (the generated text prompt as a string).
There should be exactly 6 objects in the array, one for each prompt title.
Do NOT include any other text, explanations, code block fences (like \`\`\`json), or markdown formatting outside of this single JSON array.
The JSON array should start with '[' and end with ']'.

Example of the required JSON structure:
[
  { "title": "Character - Full Body Front View", "prompt": "A detailed prompt describing the character from the front..." },
  { "title": "Character - Full Body Back View", "prompt": "A detailed prompt describing the character from the back..." },

  { "title": "Character in Scene - Cinematic Front Shot", "prompt": "A detailed prompt describing the character in a scene, front view..." },
  { "title": "Character in Scene - Cinematic Back Shot", "prompt": "A detailed prompt describing the character in a scene, back view..." },

    - Your 'qaChecklist' string must similarly separate checks for each distinct garment, using a similar heading format.
    - Your 'initialJsonPrompt' (Step 4) must aim to generate an image featuring **both distinct garments** styled appropriately together on a model (or models, if logical for the garments). The prompt should describe this complete look or ensemble clearly.

🧩 Step 1: Input Analysis
- Study the input image(s) in detail. (Handle 1 or 2 images as per the initial instruction above).
- Extract and document the following attributes. If analyzing two distinct garments, do this for each:
    - Garment type (e.g., T-shirt, kurta, dress, onesie, jacket, trousers)
    - Target wearer (infant / child / adult male / adult female)
    - Fabric type and weave (cotton, silk, denim, wool, polyester, jersey, etc.)
    - Color tone (with nuance: e.g., muted dusty blue, vibrant cherry red, matte olive green)
    - Material finish (matte / glossy / satin / velvet / dry)
    - Neckline or collar shape (round neck, V-neck, shirt collar, mandarin collar, lapel)
    - Sleeve style (sleeveless, cap sleeves, cuffed full sleeves, raglan, drop shoulder)
    - Closure details (button, zipper, hook — count, type, spacing, material)
    - Seam type (topstitched, hidden seams, visible decorative seams)
    - Print, embroidery, or patterns (type, size, placement)
    - Fit style (relaxed, slim, oversized, flared)
    - Trims and additional details (pockets, lace, elastics, belts, hoodie)
    - Edge finishing (folded, topstitched, raw hem, piped)
    - Drape and structure (soft flowy, structured crisp, rigid denim, etc.)
- Format this 'garmentAnalysis' as a multi-line string. If two distinct garments, ensure clear separation as instructed.

🛡 Step 2: Checklist Preparation
- Based on the extracted garment attributes from Step 1, dynamically build a strict QA checklist. If analyzing two distinct garments, create checklist sections for each.
- Add special checks based on garment type(s).
    - Example: For suits → lapel sharpness, vent symmetry.
    - Example: For baby onesies → snap closure spacing, fabric softness.
- Format this 'qaChecklist' as a multi-line string. If two distinct garments, ensure clear separation.

🎯 Step 3: Set Ultra-Strict QA Mode
- (This is an internal mode for you for future QA if applicable. No specific text output needed for this key in THIS response, but keep it in mind.)

📈 Step 4: Give a JSON prompt for generating an output
- Based on the input analysis (Step 1) and the QA checklist (Step 2), give a detailed JSON prompt string.
- This JSON prompt string should be suitable for use in an AI image generation model.
- The prompt should aim to generate a premium image (for socials and print) featuring the garment(s) on an appropriate person/people (inferred from garment analysis).
- If one garment was analyzed, feature that garment. If two distinct garments were analyzed, the prompt must feature **both distinct garments** styled as an ensemble or complete look.
- The prompt should specify a **STUDIO background** (e.g., seamless paper, plain wall, cyclorama) and professional studio lighting.
- Include model pose(s) and encourage variations to ensure diverse outputs when used.
- This "initialJsonPrompt" must be a single string (copy-paste ready).

Return a single JSON object with the keys "garmentAnalysis", "qaChecklist", and "initialJsonPrompt".
Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside this JSON object.
The entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
Ensure any double quotes within the string values (especially 'initialJsonPrompt') are properly escaped (e.g., "a \\"quoted\\" phrase").
Example for one garment in 'initialJsonPrompt': "A hyperrealistic fashion photograph of an adult male model wearing a [color] [garment_type] T-shirt. Studio background: light grey seamless paper. Pose: standing relaxed, hands in pockets. Camera: full body shot, 85mm lens, f/4, bright studio lighting with soft shadows. Variations: explore slight head turns, different hand placements."
Example for two distinct garments in 'initialJsonPrompt': "Fashion editorial shot of a model wearing a [Garment 1 details, e.g., 'cherry red silk blouse with puff sleeves'] paired with [Garment 2 details, e.g., 'dark wash slim-fit denim jeans']. Full body shot, model leaning against a grey cyclorama wall. Bright, crisp studio lighting. Explore poses showcasing the interaction of both garments."

export const performQaAndGenerateStudioPrompts = async (
    originalGarmentImages: ImageInput[],
    generatedFashionImage: ImageInput,
    analysisData: FashionPromptData
): Promise<RefinedStudioPrompt[]> => {
    const systemInstruction = `You are an AI fashion QA expert and prompt generator.
You will receive:
1.  Original garment image(s) (1 or 2 images showing the garment(s) to be accurately represented).
2.  A garment analysis (text describing the original garment(s) attributes. This analysis might cover one garment or two distinct garments forming an ensemble).
3.  A QA checklist (specific points to verify. This might cover one or two distinct garments).
4.  An initial JSON prompt (the prompt that was ideally used to create an image of the garment(s)).
5.  The 'generated image' (an image supposedly created based on the initial prompt, which needs QA).

Your tasks are:
A.  **Ultra-Strict QA:**
    -   Compare the 'generated image' meticulously against the 'original garment image(s)', the 'garment analysis', and the 'QA checklist'.
    -   Identify ALL discrepancies: color shifts, fabric weave differences, fit inaccuracies, incorrect seam types, pattern misplacements, errors in closure details, neckline shape, sleeve style, etc. If the analysis specified two garments, check both.
    -   Note if material finish (matte/glossy/satin) is correct for the garment(s).
    -   Assess if the 'generated image' generally adhered to the 'initial JSON prompt' in terms of pose, background, and style, but prioritize accuracy to the *original garment(s)* above all.
    -   Provide a brief summary of key QA findings if significant deviations are found (this summary is for your internal use to inform prompt generation, not for direct output in the JSON).

B.  **Refine & Generate 4 Studio Prompts:**
    -   Based on your QA AND primarily drawing from the accurate details in the 'original garment image(s)' and 'garment analysis', generate 4 NEW, highly detailed studio prompts.
    -   **IMPORTANT CONSISTENCY RULES FOR STUDIO PROMPTS:** For all 4 studio prompts below:
        1.  You **MUST** choose ONE consistent, clean studio background (e.g., "plain white seamless paper background," "soft grey cyclorama wall," "neutral textured backdrop").
        2.  You **MUST** choose ONE consistent professional studio lighting setup (e.g., "bright and even studio lighting using softboxes," "dramatic single-source key light with subtle fill," "crisp fashion studio lighting").
        3.  Use these exact same chosen background and lighting descriptions in EACH of the 4 studio prompts. Do not vary them.
    -   These prompts must aim to create images that *perfectly and accurately* represent the *original garment(s) or ensemble* as detailed in the 'garment analysis', in this consistent high-quality studio setting.
    -   The 4 studio prompts must be titled exactly:
        1.  **"Studio Prompt - Front View"**: Detailed description of the garment(s) on a model, full body or 3/4 shot, model facing front. Emphasize clear visibility of all front details of the garment or ensemble. Incorporate relevant details from the 'garment analysis'.
        2.  **"Studio Prompt - Back View"**: 
            *   **Internal Pre-computation (Mandatory for AI):** Before writing this prompt, meticulously re-examine the 'original garment image(s)' and 'garment analysis'. Internally list ALL back-specific design elements, closures, seam details, fabric behaviors, patterns, prints, texture, and any other distinguishing features visible or relevant to the back of the garment(s) or ensemble.
            *   **Prompt Generation:** This prompt is CRITICAL. Do not be generic. Based on your internal list, provide a detailed description of the garment(s) on a model, full body or 3/4 shot, model facing back/angled to showcase complete back details. Describe specific back design elements, closures, seams, cut/shape of the back, fabric drape/fit from the rear, and patterns/prints visible primarily from this perspective. If an ensemble, describe EACH garment's back. Suggest a pose that unambiguously showcases all critical back details. Incorporate all relevant back details from the 'garment analysis' and your internal pre-computation. The level of detail must be exhaustive.
        3.  **"Studio Prompt - Side View"**: Detailed description of the garment(s) on a model, full body or 3/4 shot, model in profile. Describe silhouette, fit, and side-specific details. Incorporate relevant details from the 'garment analysis'.
        4.  **"Studio Prompt - Close-up Detail"**: Focus on a specific, key feature of the garment(s). If one garment, a key detail (e.g., "texture of the fabric," "embroidery on sleeve"). If an ensemble, a key feature of *one* garment or their interaction (e.g., "close-up of the textured knit of the sweater (Garment 1) where it meets the waistband of the skirt (Garment 2)"). Be specific.
    -   For each studio prompt: Adhere to chosen consistent studio background/lighting. Suggest appropriate model pose. Incorporate all critical details from 'garment analysis'. Correct QA issues implicitly.

C.  **Generate 4 Lifestyle Prompts:**
    -   Based on your QA AND primarily drawing from the accurate details in the 'original garment image(s)' and 'garment analysis', generate 4 NEW, distinct lifestyle prompts.
    -   These prompts must aim to create images that *accurately* represent the *original garment(s) or ensemble* in realistic, aspirational, or contextually appropriate lifestyle settings.
    -   The 4 lifestyle prompts must be titled exactly:
        1.  **"Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 1"**
        2.  **"Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 2"**
        3.  **"Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 3"**
        4.  **"Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 4"**
    -   For EACH of these 4 lifestyle prompts:
        -   Invent a **unique and compelling realistic background scene** that complements the garment(s)/ensemble (e.g., " bustling city street cafe with blurred passersby," "serene beach at golden hour with soft waves," "cozy, naturally lit bookstore interior with rows of books," "modern art gallery event with abstract paintings in soft focus"). The 4 scenes must be different from each other.
        -   Describe the model wearing the garment(s) naturally within this scene.
        -   Suggest appropriate model poses (e.g., "candid walking," "sipping coffee," "looking thoughtfully at art"), dynamic camera angles (e.g., "slightly low angle," "over the shoulder," "eye-level medium shot"), and natural or stylized lighting that fits the lifestyle context (e.g., "warm afternoon sunlight filtering through leaves," "soft indoor window light," "moody ambient light of a gallery").
        -   Incorporate all critical details from the 'garment analysis' (fabric, color, fit, style, specific features for each garment if multiple) to ensure the generated image is a faithful representation of the garment(s).
        -   If your QA noted issues in the 'generated image', the new prompts should implicitly correct these by focusing on the true garment attributes.

**VERY IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMATTING for ALL 8 Prompts:**
-   Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON array of objects.
-   Each object in the array MUST have a "title" field (exactly as listed for all 8 prompts above) and a "prompt" field (the generated text prompt as a string).
-   There should be exactly 8 objects in the array (4 studio, 4 lifestyle).
-   Do NOT include any other text, explanations, code block fences (like \`\`\`json), or markdown formatting outside of this single JSON array.
-   The JSON array should start with '[' and end with ']'.
-   **Crucially, ensure that any double quotes (") within the textual description of ANY prompt MUST be escaped (e.g., using \\\\" for a quote, so it would look like: "a model wearing a \\\\\\"silken\\\\\\" dress").**
Example JSON structure (first 2 studio, first lifestyle):
[
  { "title": "Studio Prompt - Front View", "prompt": "Full body studio shot... Background: plain white seamless paper. Lighting: bright, even softbox lighting..." },
  { "title": "Studio Prompt - Back View", "prompt": "Full body studio shot, model facing away... Background: plain white seamless paper. Lighting: bright, even softbox lighting..." },
  { "title": "Studio Prompt - Side View", "prompt": "..." },
  { "title": "Studio Prompt - Close-up Detail", "prompt": "..." },
  { "title": "Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 1", "prompt": "Candid shot of a model wearing [garment details] at a bustling outdoor market... Background: colorful fruit stalls, blurred shoppers. Lighting: bright, natural daylight..." },
  { "title": "Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 2", "prompt": "..." },
  { "title": "Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 3", "prompt": "..." },
  { "title": "Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 4", "prompt": "..." }
]
Ensure all string values within the JSON (especially the 'prompt' values) are correctly escaped.`;
