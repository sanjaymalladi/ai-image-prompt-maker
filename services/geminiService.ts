Your task is to generate a series of 6 distinct text prompts for AI image generation, based on this single character.
The prompts should enable the creation of a character sheet, showing the character from different angles and in various settings.

The 6 prompts must be:
1.  **"Character - Full Body Front View"**: A detailed description of the character seen from the front. Focus on their full body appearance, clothing, hairstyle, facial features, accessories, and any notable details.
2.  **"Character - Full Body Back View"**: A detailed description of the character seen from the back. Describe their clothing from behind, hairstyle from the back, and any details visible from this angle.
3.  **"Character - Full Body Side View"**: A detailed description of the character seen from the side (e.g., left profile). Describe their profile, clothing from the side, and posture.
4.  **"Character in Scene - Cinematic Front Shot"**: Describe the character (front-facing or slightly angled) within a simple, consistent background scene (e.g., "standing on a gritty urban street at night with neon signs in the background" or "in a sunlit meadow with tall grass"). The prompt should specify a camera shot like "medium full shot" or "cowboy shot". The focus is on the character integrated into this scene. The scene details for this prompt should be consistent.
5.  **"Character in Scene - Cinematic Back Shot"**: Describe the character (back-facing) within a background scene and lighting conditions. This scene can be different from the 'Cinematic Front Shot'. Use a similar camera shot (e.g., "medium full shot from behind"). The focus is on the character from behind, integrated into a scene.
6.  **"Character - Realistic Crazy Shot"**: ${crazyShotInstruction}

For all prompts, include details on:
- Subject appearance (as visible from the angle)
- Attire and textures
- Hairstyle and color
- Key distinguishing features
- For scene prompts: setting, lighting, mood, camera angle, and composition. The background scene elements for "Character in Scene - Cinematic Front Shot" (prompt 4) should be internally consistent for that prompt.

**VERY IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMATTING:**
Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON array of objects.
Each object in the array MUST have a "title" field (exactly as listed above, e.g., "Character - Full Body Front View") and a "prompt" field (the generated text prompt as a string).
There should be exactly 6 objects in the array, one for each prompt title.
Do NOT include any other text, explanations, code block fences (like \`\`\`json), or markdown formatting outside of this single JSON array.
The JSON array should start with '[' and end with ']'.

Example of the required JSON structure:
[
  { "title": "Character - Full Body Front View", "prompt": "A detailed prompt describing the character from the front..." },
  { "title": "Character - Full Body Back View", "prompt": "A detailed prompt describing the character from the back..." },
  { "title": "Character - Full Body Side View", "prompt": "A detailed prompt describing the character from the side..." },
  { "title": "Character in Scene - Cinematic Front Shot", "prompt": "A detailed prompt describing the character in a scene, front view..." },
  { "title": "Character in Scene - Cinematic Back Shot", "prompt": "A detailed prompt describing the character in a scene, back view..." },
  { "title": "Character - Realistic Crazy Shot", "prompt": "A detailed prompt for a realistic crazy shot..." }
]

BRAND-NEUTRALITY & MANNEQUIN POLICY:
- If ANY brand logos, wordmarks, or recognizable branding appears, describe ONLY as "graphic pattern" or "design element" — NEVER mention brand names.
- If garments are displayed on mannequins, IGNORE mannequins entirely and analyze only garment attributes.
- Generated prompts must specify photorealistic human models only, never mannequins.
Follow these steps extremely carefully and return the output as a single JSON object with three keys: "garmentAnalysis", "qaChecklist", and "initialJsonPrompt".

🧩 Step 1: Input Analysis
- Study the input garment image(s) in detail. (Handle 1 or 2 images as per the initial instruction above).
- Extract and document the following attributes. If analyzing two distinct garments, do this for each:
    - Garment type (e.g., T-shirt, kurta, dress, onesie, jacket, trousers)
    - Target wearer (infant / child / adult male / adult female)
    - Fabric type and weave (cotton, silk, denim, wool, polyester, jersey, etc.)
    - Color tone (with nuance: e.g., muted dusty blue, vibrant cherry red, matte olive green)
    - Material finish (matte / glossy / satin / velvet / dry)
    - Neckline or collar shape (round neck, V-neck, shirt collar, mandarin collar, lapel)
    - Sleeve style (sleeveless, cap sleeves, cuffed full sleeves, raglan, drop shoulder)
    - Closure details (button, zipper, hook — count, type, spacing, material)
    - Seam type (topstitched, hidden seams, visible decorative seams)
    - Print, embroidery, or patterns (type, size, placement)
    - Fit style (relaxed, slim, oversized, flared)
    - Trims and additional details (pockets, lace, elastics, belts, hoodie)
    - Edge finishing (folded, topstitched, raw hem, piped)
    - Drape and structure (soft flowy, structured crisp, rigid denim, etc.)
- Format this 'garmentAnalysis' as a multi-line string. If two distinct garments, ensure clear separation as instructed.
${referenceImageInstructions ? `\n- Also consider any provided reference images for background or model appearance when formulating descriptions later, but the core garment analysis here is based on the garment images ONLY.` : ''}

🛡 Step 2: Checklist Preparation
- Based on the extracted garment attributes from Step 1, dynamically build a strict QA checklist. If analyzing two distinct garments, create checklist sections for each.
- Add special checks based on garment type(s).
    - Example: For suits → lapel sharpness, vent symmetry.
    - Example: For baby onesies → snap closure spacing, fabric softness.
- Format this 'qaChecklist' as a multi-line string. If two distinct garments, ensure clear separation.

🎯 Step 3: Set Ultra-Strict QA Mode
- (This is an internal mode for you for future QA if applicable. No specific text output needed for this key in THIS response, but keep it in mind.)

📈 Step 4: Give a JSON prompt for generating an output
- Based on the input analysis (Step 1) and the QA checklist (Step 2), give a detailed JSON prompt string.
- This JSON prompt string should be suitable for use in an AI image generation model.
- The prompt should aim to generate a premium image (for socials and print) featuring the garment(s) on an appropriate person/people (inferred from garment analysis).
- If one garment was analyzed, feature that garment. If two distinct garments were analyzed, the prompt must feature **both distinct garments** styled as an ensemble or complete look.
- The prompt must specify a **STUDIO background**.
    - If background reference images were provided (see Step 1 instructions), ensure the studio background description (e.g., seamless paper color, texture, simple props) is creatively inspired by their style, mood, or key elements, while *remaining a clean studio setup*. For example, if a reference shows a moody forest, the studio background might be "dark olive green seamless paper with subtle dappled lighting effect" rather than an actual forest.
    - If no background references, use a standard professional studio background (e.g., "light grey seamless paper," "plain white cyclorama wall").
- The prompt must specify professional studio lighting.
- If model reference images were provided (see Step 1 instructions), the description of the model in this JSON prompt should aim to have the generated model resemble the characteristics (features, hair, ethnicity, body type if discernible and appropriate) from those reference images.
- Include model pose(s) and encourage variations to ensure diverse outputs when used.
- This "initialJsonPrompt" must be a single string (copy-paste ready).

Return a single JSON object with the keys "garmentAnalysis", "qaChecklist", and "initialJsonPrompt".
Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting outside this JSON object.
The entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
Ensure any double quotes within the string values (especially 'initialJsonPrompt') are properly escaped (e.g., "a \\"quoted\\" phrase").

Original garment image(s)
A garment analysis
A QA checklist
An initial JSON prompt
The 'generated image'

BRAND-SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
- Ensure NO brand names, logos, or commercial identifiers appear in analysis or generated prompts.
- All brand elements must be described as "graphic pattern" or "design element" only.
- Photorealistic human models only, never mannequins.

Your tasks are:

A. Ultra-Strict QA with COLOR and MATERIAL Focus:
- Compare the 'generated image' meticulously against the 'original garment image(s)', the 'garment analysis', and the 'QA checklist'.
- Identify ALL discrepancies: color fidelity, fabric weave/texture, fit/silhouette, seam types, pattern placement, closure details, neckline/collar shape, sleeve style, trims, and material finish.
- Note if material finish (matte/glossy/satin/velvet/dry) is correct for the garment(s).
- Assess adherence to the 'initial JSON prompt' for pose, background, and style, but prioritize accuracy to the original garment(s).

B. Generate 4 Studio Prompts ONLY:
- Based on your QA and primarily drawing from the accurate details in the original garment image(s) and garment analysis, generate 4 NEW, highly detailed studio prompts.
- CRITICAL STUDIO REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Choose ONE consistent studio background (e.g., light grey seamless paper, plain white cyclorama wall, neutral textured backdrop) and use it in all 4 prompts.
    2. Choose ONE consistent professional studio lighting setup (e.g., even softbox lighting with gentle rim; fashion lighting with soft key and subtle fill) and use it in all 4 prompts.
    3. Human model only; no mannequins. Natural skin texture with visible pores.
    4. Encourage technical specificity where helpful (e.g., 85mm equivalent, f/2.8–f/5.6, soft diffused lighting).
- Titles required exactly:
    "Studio Prompt - Front View"
    "Studio Prompt - Back View"
    "Studio Prompt - Side View"
    "Studio Prompt - Close-up Detail"
- For "Studio Prompt - Back View": explicitly describe back-specific elements (closures, seams, yoke/vent, pattern continuation, drape from rear) and a pose that reveals them clearly.

C. Generate 4 Lifestyle Prompts with CONSISTENT Background:
- Establish ONE single, richly detailed lifestyle background that complements the garment's style and intended use (e.g., urban street, cafe terrace, park, office, gallery, seasonal setting). Use this exact same background description for all 4 lifestyle prompts.
- Vary only poses/angles and camera perspectives while maintaining garment accuracy and model consistency.
- Titles required exactly:
    "Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 1"
    "Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 2"
    "Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 3"
    "Lifestyle Prompt - Scene 4"
- Within each lifestyle prompt: start with the consistent background, then specify model action/pose, camera angle, and lighting appropriate to that setting. Maintain color/material accuracy.

VERY IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return a SINGLE valid JSON OBJECT with the following keys:
  - "qaFindings": A string summarizing the QA results. Use clear bullet points or concise paragraphs. Include discrepancies found and confirmations of accuracy.
  - "prompts": An array of exactly 8 objects for the refined prompts.
- Each item in "prompts" MUST have a "title" (exactly as listed above) and a "prompt" string.
- Do NOT include any other text, explanations, or code fences outside of this single JSON object.
- Ensure double quotes inside strings are escaped (e.g., \"quoted phrase\").`;
